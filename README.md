## Project Overview

FR3AK is a conversation intelligence system designed to analyze emotional and behavioral dynamics across multi-user chat transcripts. It combines sequential message parsing, Plutchik-based emotion modeling, behavior classification, and insight generation into a unified analytics workflow.

Core capabilities include:

- Emotional analysis using an 8-dimensional Plutchik emotion representation.
- Sarcasm detection from lexical, contextual, and rule-based signals.
- Manipulation detection through staged behavioral classification.
- Visual analytics with emotional trend timelines, sarcasm/manipulation timelines, and Plutchik wheel signatures.

## Features

- Multi-user conversation parsing with speaker and timestamp normalization.
- Emotion tracking over time across each participant.
- Sarcasm and manipulation detection at message and user levels.
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard for profile and trajectory exploration.

## Scoring Notes

Emotion intensity in the analyzer is computed from emotion dominance, not probability mass sum.

Current analyzer formula:

```python
emotion_array = np.array(emotion_vector)
raw_intensity = np.max(emotion_array) - np.mean(emotion_array)
emotion_intensity = float(raw_intensity / (np.max(emotion_array) + 1e-6))
```

Interpretation:

- Higher dominance of one emotion gives higher intensity (typically near 0.7-1.0).
- Flatter emotion distributions give lower intensity (typically near 0.1-0.3).

Where this scoring is used:

- `pipeline/analyzer.py`: computes per-message `emotion_intensity` and aggregates user-level averages.
- `pipeline/visualizer.py`: uses `emotion_intensity` directly and applies the same dominance formula as a fallback if intensity is missing.
- `pipeline/insights.py`: maps `avg_emotion_intensity` into low/moderate/high intensity language.
- `app.py`: renders message-level intensity trends in the user dashboard.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AaditPani-RVU/FR3AK.git
cd FR3AK
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with only the required variables:

```env
FR3AK_BEHAVIOR_DATASET_REF=...
FR3AK_EMOTION_DATASET_REF=...

KAGGLE_USERNAME=your_username
KAGGLE_KEY=your_key
```

### Kaggle API Setup

1. Go to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
2. Navigate to Account Settings
3. Click "Create New API Token"
4. Download `kaggle.json`

From this file, extract:

- `username` -> `KAGGLE_USERNAME`
- `key` -> `KAGGLE_KEY`

Then place them in your `.env` file.

### Notes

- Dataset references are used to automatically fetch required data.
- No manual dataset setup is required if `.env` is configured correctly.
- The system is fully Kaggle-integrated.

## Model and Data Setup

FR3AK supports two model artifact flows:

- Runtime resolution via configured Kaggle dataset references.
- Local artifact usage after downloading model datasets from Kaggle.

Sarcasm lexicon construction:

```bash
python build_sarcasm_lexicon.py
```

Alternative from repository layout:

```bash
python utils/build_sarcasm_lexicon.py
```

Data/model sources used by the project include Kaggle-hosted model assets and dataset-backed artifacts configured in environment variables.

Primary model data:

- Behavior/sarcasm model:
  [incongruity-classfier](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bobhendriks/incongruity-classfier)

- Emotion model (Plutchik-based):
  [plutchik-model-v2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bobhendriks/plutchik-model-v2)

## Model Training

The `training/` directory contains 7 notebooks used to train the models used in this project.

You can:

- Inspect how the models were trained
- Reproduce results
- Train your own models using these notebooks

This includes:

- Emotion model training (Plutchik-based)
- Behavior/sarcasm detection training

## Run Pipeline

```bash
python tests/final_pipeline_test.py
```

This executes the full analysis path: input parsing, message-level emotion/behavior inference, user-level aggregation, comparative insights, and visualization payload generation.

## Run Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The dashboard provides:

- File upload for `.txt`/`.json` conversation data.
- User-level profile cards and behavioral summaries.
- Emotional trend, sarcasm timeline, and manipulation timeline plots.
- Plutchik emotional signature visualization per participant.

## Testing

The `tests/` folder contains component and pipeline validation scripts.

Run selected tests:

```bash
python tests/emotion_test.py
python tests/analyzer_test.py
python tests/insights_test.py
python tests/visualizer_test.py
```

What these validate:

- Emotion model loading and inference shape/output behavior.
- Conversation analyzer message and user aggregation logic.
- Insight generation consistency for multi-user interactions.
- Visualization flow and plot generation compatibility.

## Future Work

- Upgrade to stronger domain-tuned behavior models.
- Add real-time streaming conversation analysis.
- Expose FR3AK as a deployable API service.

## Data Sources

- Conversation input format is user-provided and supports `.txt` and `.json` conversation exports.
- Input records are parsed from speaker/message/timestamp structures through the project parsing pipeline.

This project is model-driven and does not rely on a fixed dataset at runtime. However, models may have been trained on publicly available datasets such as:

- GoEmotions (Google)
- Emotion datasets published on Kaggle and research repositories
- Sarcasm datasets (Twitter/Reddit based)
- Kaggle-hosted behavior/emotion datasets configured via environment variables

Notes by task area:

- Sarcasm detection: rule- and lexicon-augmented behavior inference, with optional lexicon generation from public text/data sources.
- Emotion analysis: transformer-based emotion modeling aligned to Plutchik-style dimensions.
- Manipulation detection: staged behavioral classifier pipeline using loaded model artifacts.

## Models & Libraries

- Transformers for tokenizer/model integration and model configuration loading.
- PyTorch as the primary inference backend for emotion and behavior modeling.
- Matplotlib for timeline and radial emotion visualizations.
- Streamlit for the interactive analysis dashboard and user workflow.
- NumPy for numeric processing in plotting and feature handling.
